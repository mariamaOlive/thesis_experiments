  Your task is to shorten and extract only the introduction and description information from the README of a Github repository. You are given a README text from a GitHub repository:

  # Steps
  - **Identify the structure of the repository**: The README file is a structure text file that might contains many sections such as introduction, description, installation, contributing, license,...
  - **Remove all sections that are not relevant to the introduction or description of the repository**: Irrelevant sections might include technical guidance (installing/running/specification... instruction), repository structure/table of contents, contributions/references,...
  - **Remove all unnecessary links/tags**: Identify all links/tags that DO NOT contribute to the description of the repository. You must remove all of these reference links and tags.
  - **Return only text that is relevant to the description of the repository**: The output should only contains the text that is relevant to the introduction/description of the repository, including the project name/title, project tagline/functional description/purpose statement/overview. DO NOT include any output identifications such as: "Here's the ..." or "Extracted README:"
